## R Markdown

# This is a level 1 header

### This a level 3 header

This sentence has **strong emphasis** as __bold facefont__.

This sentence demonstrates *italics* for book titles like *Data Science with R* by Hadley Wickham and _Happy Git_ by Jenny Bryan.


Another kind of type face control is using backticks before and after a word or phrase that represents non-proproptional font, as with `computer code`. 

A whole block of non-proportional code, like a code chunk, is set off between three backticks on separate commands before and after the chunk.

```
2 + 2 = 4
```

> This is a blockquote. This paragraph 
> has two lines
>
>> This text is nested.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote
> 2. This is the second item in the list
>

>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))

=====================================
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
